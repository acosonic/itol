Issue Tracker for Microsoft Outlook based on JOA

  This version creates a project with identifier "itol-configuration".
  Its description is used to store the definition of the 
  custom properties for any user. Since Redmine allows only administrators
  to read custom property definitions - maybe because select lists could
  contain secrets - they are stored in an encrypted format.
  Since every user can modify the JavaScript interface, everyone can 
  access the decrypted information if she or he is really interested in.
  Thus, ITOL should not be used in environments, where custom properties
  contain secrets.
