Issue Tracker Addin for Microsoft Outlook and Redmine

  ITOL creates issues for Redmine on received mails from within Microsoft Outlook. 
  It seamlessly integrates with the mail inspector window and allows you to enter the 
  issue properties and lets you add additional file attachments.

  This program creates a project with identifier "itol-configuration".
  Its description is used to store the definition of the 
  custom properties for any user. Since Redmine allows only administrators
  to read custom property definitions - maybe because select lists could
  contain secrets - they are stored in an encrypted format.
  Since every user can modify the JavaScript interface, everyone can 
  access the decrypted information if she or he is really interested in.
  Thus, ITOL should not be used in environments, where custom properties
  contain secrets.
  
  The first user that starts ITOL should be an administrator. This 
  allows to create the "itol-configuration" project. The display name of the project
  is "Issue Tracker for Microsoft Outlook and Redmine Configuration". It can be 
  changed as well as the project's parent. ITOL only tries to find the project
  by its identifier "itol-configuration" (which must not be changed).
