Version History

Version 1.3 2015-03-17

- #16: Issues could not be created if no custom fields were defined.

- Requested by Benoit LM at redmine.org/plugins/itol:
  	* See the list of projects with a hierarchical view.
  	  Sub projects are shown like "main » sub" in the projects list. 
	* Attach an email to existing task.
  	  An email can be dragged into the attachment list.
  	  
- Replace only those characters in the attachment file name that are forbidden 
  for file names in Windows. Previous versions replaced any character except 
  "a-Z" and "0-9".
  
- JDK 8u40, Visual Studio 2010 Runtime Components are no more required.

Version 1.2 2015-02-26

- #7 New issues can be created without an existing mail.

- #8 Tracker list is updated when project is changed.

- #9 User list is updated when project is changed.

- #10 Due date can be set.

- #14 Only the last issue ID remains in the mail subject.

- This program creates a project with identifier "itol-configuration".
  Its description is used to store the definition of the 
  custom properties for any user, see readme.txt.

- The issue dialog layout was completely new designed.
  
- A history tab shows the web view of the entire issue by calling Redmine's 
  web interface.
  
- The issue dialog is integrated with the Outlook explorer (main window), too.

- The issue dialog allows to display any issue by entering the issue ID.

- Simple support of custom fields. Fields of type "user" and "version"
  are unsupported. Fields of type "Integer", "Float", "Link", and "Long text" 
  are entered as Text. Default values are supported. Other options regarding
  the field type are unsupported. Field visibility for projects, trackers 
  and users should be interpreted correctly.
