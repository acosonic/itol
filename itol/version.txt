Issue Tracker Addin for Microsoft Outlook
Version History

Version 1.2 2015-02-23

- This version creates a project with identifier "itol-configuration".
  Its description is used to store the definition of the 
  custom properties for any user. Since Redmine allows only administrators
  to read custom property definitions - maybe because select lists could
  contain secrets - they are stored in an encrypted format.
  Since every user can modify the JavaScript interface, everyone can 
  access the decrypted information if she or he is really interested in.
  Thus, ITOL should not be used in environments, where custom properties
  contain secrets.
  
- #7 New issues can be created without an existing mail.

- #8 Tracker list is updated when project is changed.

- #9 User list is updated when project is changed.

- #10 Due date can be set.

- #14 Only the last issue ID remains in the mail subject.

- The first user that starts ITOL should be an administrator. This 
  allows to create the "itol-configuration" project. The display name of the project
  is "Issue Tracker for Microsoft Outlook and Redmine Configuration". It can be 
  changed as well as the project's parent. ITOL only tries to find the project
  by its identifier "itol-configuration" (which must not be changed). 
  
- The issue dialog layout was completely new designed.
  
- A history tab shows the web view of the entire issue by calling Redmine's 
  web interface.
  
- The issue dialog is integrated with the Outlook explorer (main window), too.

- The issue dialog allows to display any issue by entering the issue ID.

- Simple support of custom fields. Fields of type "user" and "version"
  are unsupported. Fields of type "Integer", "Float", "Link", and "Long text" 
  are entered as Text. Default values are supported. Other options regarding
  the field type are unsupported. Field visibility for projects, trackers 
  and users should be interpreted correctly.
